        <h3>10/2022 - 02/2023</h3>
        <h3>Aramco</h3>
        <h3>VR Commercial Project – Hinkah</h3>
        <p>
            In my role as a junior game developer, I had the chance to work on a VR commercial
            project with a client provided by a game development boot camp course. Using the Unity
            Engine, I was able to create a prototype of Soft Skills training which was presented to
            hundreds of investors in Saudi Arabia.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the coding side, I wrote scripts for the game prototype in C#, and developed UI
            elements, for the buttons I added audio and functionalities, for all conversations for both
            languages (English and Arabic), and audio too, for every text and audio, I had to
            implement localization. The hands interactions with the UI and scenes, teleportation, etc...
            Make the 3D animations work in the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client requested a system of answers like a quiz, with specification points for the
            correct answers.
            I also served as the communication leader, managing the expectations of the client,
            keeping them informed on our progress, and scheduling meetings. This was a valuable
            experience that allowed me to further develop my skills in game development and gain a
            better understanding of the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I took the initiative to learn new technologies and techniques to improve the
            game's design and keep up with industry standards.
