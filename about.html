        <h1>Hi there, I’m Vinicius!</h1>
        <h2>(You can call me Vini)</h2>
        <h3>Let me share with you a bit about me:</h3>
        <p>
            Following my first career as a professional footballer, I spent 8 years in the hospitality industry,
            working my way up from the bottom as KP to Head Chef. In 2022 I made the decision to change career and
            follow my true passion - game development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Starting in 2015 I have been studying game development in my spare time, and improving my programming skills.
            Since completing a game development bootcamp in 2023, I have been working in Localisation Quality Assurance contributing to AAA games.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I’m actively seeking opportunities to join a team and contribute my skills and competencies to game development.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game industry will greatly benefit from all the personal skills and competencies I bring with me from my past careers and experience.
            I will draw on these qualities to participate as a strong team player creating immersive gaming experiences.
        </p>
        <p>Success in hospitality demands resilience, teamwork, good communication, creativity and an eye for detail. </p>

        <p>
            In particular I keep a calm clear head to deliver high quality results, even in highly stressful, time pressured and demanding situations.
            Many colleagues and managers have been impressed by my ability to calmly and quickly deliver attractive and enjoyable food, for many people,
            in a hot kitchen with a small team.
        </p>

        <p>My contribution has led to significantly improved customer satisfaction and positive online reviews for the businesses I worked for within the hospitality industry.</p>

        <p>Becoming a professional footballer takes dedication, perseverance, self-motivation, teamwork, strategy and professionalism. </p>

        <p>
            From the age of 8 I committed to training three times a week, overcoming many obstacles with my determination. Aged 14 I left home to pursue my football career,
            joining the under 15 team at Vasco, one of the top Brazilian clubs. I became professional at age 18.
        </p>

        <p>Throughout my football career, I consistently earned the honour of team captain. This reflected my natural leadership qualities, along with my ability to inspire and motivate others.</p>

        <p>With these strong abilities and my passion for innovation in gaming, I am confident that I will create success within the game industry.</p>

        <p>Let’s discuss the potential for me to join your team! </p>
