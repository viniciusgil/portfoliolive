            <h2>VR Soft Skills Communication Project - Aramco</h2>
            <p>
                In this Aramco Project my role as a junior game developer, I had the chance to work on a
                VR commercial project with a client provided by a game development bootcamp course.
                Using the Unity Engine, I was able to create a prototype of Soft Skills training
                which was presented to hundreds of investors in Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the coding side, I wrote scripts for the game prototype in C#, and developed UI elements,
                for the buttons I added audio and functionalities, for all conversations for both languages
                (English and Arabic), and audio too, for every text and audio, I had to implement
                localization. The hands interactions with the UI and scenes, teleportation, etc... Make the
                3D animations work in the scenes.
                The client requested a system of answers like a quiz, with specification points for the correct answers.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also served as the communication leader, managing the expectations of the client, keeping
                them informed on our progress, and scheduling meetings. This was a valuable experience
                that allowed me to further develop my skills in game development and gain a better
                understanding of the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I took the initiative to learn new technologies and techniques to improve the
                game's design and keep up with industry standards.
            </p>
